# Into-the-pong
Into the Pong is a minimalist roguelike reimagining of the classic arcade game. Score points to unlock random upgrades that alter paddles, balls, and arenas while your opponent mutates in unpredictable ways. With clean visuals and evolving soundscapes, each run becomes a unique and chaotic challenge.
