Into the Pong is a minimalist roguelike twist on the classic arcade game. What begins as a simple match of Pong quickly evolves into a chaotic, ever-changing experience where no two runs are the same.  Each point scored grants you randomized upgrades that reshape the match â€” splitting paddles, duplicating balls, distorting arenas, or even bending the laws of physics. Meanwhile, your opponent adapts with their own unpredictable mutations, turning every rally into a test of reflex, strategy, and adaptability.  With its clean aesthetic, dynamic soundscape, and escalating unpredictability, Into the Pong transforms a timeless classic into an elegant yet explosive roguelike challenge.
